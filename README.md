# ddcc - Double-difference cross-correlation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/malcolmw/ddcc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/malcolmw/ddcc)
# !!!DEPRECATED!!! This repository is inefficient and I do not advise using it. Consider instead using scripts in [PyCatEQ](https://github.com/malcolmw/PyCatEQ).

Parallel double-difference cross-correlation code based on [pyasdf](http://seismicdata.github.io/pyasdf).

The aim of this code is to measure differential travel-times--on large datasets by cross-correlating waveforms--for relocating earthquakes with a double-difference method.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/malcolmw/ddcc/wiki) for instructions on installing and using ddcc.
